    <h1 class = "pg-heading"> Professional Experience</h1>
    <p class = "body-text"> My experience spans academia, research, and community engagement, where I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence, innovation, and collaboration. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege to educate future doctors, educate future public health leaders, guide students through their academic journeys, and contribute to initiatives that focuses on improving health in the Caribbean.

              <p class="card-dropdown-textbox">In my role as an instructor, I have designed and delivered lectures on health policy and management, epidemiology and health systems at the graduate level (MD and MPH students). I have facilitated these sessions in various formats including face to face, online learning and blended learning. I have also served as an academic advisor and learning strategist to help support student learning. In addition to academic courses, I led and developed a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and a selective at SGU on Digital Health in Medicine. My teaching philosophy centers on fostering critical thinking and practical application of knowledge. I strive to create an engaging learning environment that encourages students to explore complex public health issues, equipping them with the tools they need to excel in their future careers and make a positive impact on society. By staying current with the latest research and trends in public health, I ensure that my students receive an education that is both relevant and forward-thinking.</p>

              <p class="card-dropdown-textbox">Mentorship has been a cornerstone of my professional journey. As a learning strategist I supported the academic and professional growth and development of medical students. This continued with my transition to my role as a faculty member in Public Health. Through one-on-one advising, I help students navigate their educational paths, offering guidance on research projects, career choices, and academic challenges. My approach to mentorship is rooted in empathy and active listening, as I believe that understanding each individual's unique needs and goals is key to providing effective support. I take pride in helping my mentees achieve their full potential, fostering a culture of continuous learning and mutual respect.</p>
