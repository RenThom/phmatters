        <p class = "body-text">Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio. I am an early-career public health professional and educator deeply committed to improving health services within the Caribbean and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). With a background in health policy, epidemiology, and management, I strive to inspire positive change through ethical leadership, compassionate advocacy, and forward-thinking solutions. I am passionate about creating sustainable initiatives that address the unique challenges faced by SIDS. I believe in the power of collaboration and community engagement, recognizing that the most effective solutions come from working closely with those who are directly impacted. Through my work, I aim to not only address immediate health concerns but also to build resilient systems that will support future generations. My approach is rooted in rigorous research and a deep dedication to service, ensuring that the solutions I develop are both impactful and enduring. </p>
